Have you done the chat, voice call app natively on flutter before?
We have an existing app . The mobile is on flutter framework while the backend is developed on lareval PHP . The app has call chat video features . The call chat video was build on web rtc agora flutter . Of works well but it doesn’t connect or notify the user when the app dead and when the phone is locked . There is no push notification as flutter doesn’t allow it . We have tried to integrate with firebase for the push notification but it doesn’t work perfectly . 

So the requirement is to build on our existing backend and mobile a chat , call , video features that works exactly like WhatsApp with push notifications even when the app is killed , minimized , on background and when the phone is locked . 

as written on the project description... it says chat, voice cal lsimilar to whatsapp.
I guess that says it all.

it is a digital paymnet app with call, chat features but we hav issuess with the call features as the flutter plguins do not enable a call notification when the app is killed.
so we need a native  solution just for the chat, voice call.

here is the code where the oroginal agora flutter plugins were build but no notifications when the app is killed.
